/*
On C++ most vexing parse:
In C++ anything that can be parsed as a declaration will be parsed as one. The following:
StratFunApproach::GameCharacter gc2(StratFunApproach::loseHealthSlow());
will be parsed as a function gc2 that returns a GameCharater and takes as input a function (that itself returns a loseHealthSlow object with no parameters).

int f(A()); 
is shorthand for:
int f(A(*)());
That is: f is a function taking a pointer to a function returning an A.
Thatâ€™s a legacy rule going back to C. You can see the same behavior with 
int x(int());
which is a declaration of a function x that takes a pointer to a function returning int.
